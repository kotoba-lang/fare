(ns kotoba.fare
  "Filed fares, fare rules, fare construction and lowest-fare search —
  pure data contracts.

  A kotoba-lang capability library for the pricing half of a flight
  shopping engine. `kotoba.itinerary` answers *which sequences of flights
  actually connect*; `kotoba.reservation` answers *how many are left to
  sell* and *what one operator's own rate plan charges*. Neither answers
  the question a fare search is asked: **given these itineraries and
  these filed fares, what is the lowest price that is actually
  applicable, and why.**

  Portable (.cljc) across JVM / ClojureScript / SCI / GraalVM. No
  network, no I/O, no ambient clock, no floating point.

  ## Why this is worth having at all

  A language model asked for the cheapest fare will produce a number. It
  will be plausible, formatted correctly, and frequently wrong — the
  advance-purchase window unchecked, a blackout date ignored, a fare
  applied to a carrier that never filed it. The point of this namespace
  is not to make an advisor better at that. It is to let a GOVERNOR
  recompute the answer from the filed fares and reject the claim when
  the arithmetic disagrees:

    `price-matches-claim?`  -- is that total what these fares actually add to?
    `fare-applies?`         -- is this fare even eligible for this journey?
    `no-cheaper-than?`      -- is \"cheapest\" actually the cheapest here?

  The last one is the one that does not exist anywhere else in this
  fleet. `kotoba.reservation/quote-matches-claim?` verifies a price
  against ONE rate plan. Verifying a *shopping* claim means re-running
  the search, because \"this is the lowest fare\" is a statement about
  every fare that was not chosen.

  ## Determinism, and why there are no floats here

  Every amount is an integer. Fares filed in a currency are integers in
  that currency's MINOR UNIT (JPY: 1 = ¥1; USD: 1 = 1 cent). Fares filed
  in Neutral Units of Construction are integers in HUNDREDTHS OF A NUC,
  converted with an integer rate of exchange scaled by 10^4 (see
  `nuc->minor`). Percentage taxes are integers in BASIS POINTS
  (`bp-scale` = 10000 = 100%), applied with truncating integer division.

  Truncation is a real decision. IATA's own currency rounding rules
  round NUC fares UP to the next unit for most currencies; this library
  truncates instead, so a converted fare can only ever land at or below
  the rounded one. That is deliberate: this library will not quietly
  invent a rounding convention that changes what a passenger is charged.
  An operator whose filing requires IATA rounding files in the currency
  and passes `:fare/amount` directly, and the conversion never runs.

  ## No clock, and no derived facts

  Nothing here reads a clock, and nothing here derives a date fact. An
  advance-purchase check needs to know how many days lie between the
  sale and the flight; this namespace takes that number as data rather
  than computing it, exactly the way `kotoba.reservation/quote-for`
  takes each date's weekday as data. `kotoba.itinerary/days-between` and
  `/weekday-of` are the pure functions both an advisor and a governor
  should derive those facts with — one implementation, so that a
  disagreement about eligibility can never turn out to be a
  disagreement about what day it was.

  ## Unverifiable is not the same as satisfied

  When a fare files a rule and the fact needed to check it is missing,
  the fare does NOT apply, and the reported violation says so
  (`:advance-purchase-unverifiable`, `:day-of-week-unverifiable`, ...).
  Assuming compliance because the input was incomplete is how a search
  returns a fare nobody is entitled to. This follows the same stance
  ADR-2800002200 took for `cloud-itonami-isic-5110`: a check that cannot
  run is a violation, not a pass.

  ## What this library does NOT implement

  Named, because a fare engine that quietly omits a category prices
  tickets that cannot be issued:

  - **ATPCO category 10, fare combinability.** Components here price
    INDEPENDENTLY, which is what makes `search` able to take the cheapest
    applicable fare per component (see `search`). Real combinability
    restricts which fare components may sit in one ticket, and would
    invalidate that optimization. Not implemented, not approximated.
  - **Categories 12 (surcharges), 14 (travel restrictions), 17 (HIP /
    higher intermediate point), 23 (miscellaneous), 25 (fare by rule).**
    Surcharges are accepted as caller-supplied data (`:surcharges`)
    rather than derived from a filing.
  - **Routing maps as graphs.** `:fare/routing` here is an ordered list
    of permitted points and a component's intermediates must be a
    subsequence of it. Published routing maps are directed graphs with
    alternate branches; the subsequence rule accepts a strict subset of
    what a real map permits, so it can reject a fare that is genuinely
    applicable. It never accepts one that is not.
  - **Ticketing, filing, settlement.** Nothing here files a fare with an
    authority, issues a document, or moves money."
